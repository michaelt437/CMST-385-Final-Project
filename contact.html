<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Michael, and if you haven't noticed, I like to draw.  Art is a very passionate hobby of mine, and it has been for years.  It started when my friends in grade school had drawing skills and I wanted to join in the fun.  We had competitions during lunch to see who drew the better creatures and monsters.  <br><br> Fast forward to today, I've graduated from sketching on lined paper to trying to understand the fundamentals of drawing and painting, like perspective and lighting.  I discovered artists old and new that I look up to and gain inspiration from.  Now my greatest competition is myself, and with this site I hope to continue to improve, but most importantly have fun! </p>
